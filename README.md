# RoboSphere

Currently does !!absolutely nothing!!

It's a general purpose bot built using [Remora.Discord](https://github.com/Nihlus/Remora.Discord).

It's main goal is to provide realtime game data tracking.

## Configuration

The bot depends on Settings.json to be updated with the bot's user id (this is due to how commands will be triggered.)

All other settings are controlled via commands.

## Command Prefix

The bot's command prefix is hardcoded to match the bot's handle, to execute commands you have to mention the bot with the command.
